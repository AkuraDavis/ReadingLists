## About ReadingLists
A small Laravel App to create and manage reading lists for books.

##### Features:

- Register, Login, Password Reset (Laravel Auth)
- Create, Update, and View Books
- Create, Update, View, and Delete Lists (per user)
- Add and Remove books from lists
- Upload a Thumbnail on Book Creation
- Sort and search
- reCaptcha
- Google Books API Integration

##### Possible Improvements
The app probably needs some sort of administration system if you want to implement
the public/private book flags correctly, for a curated directory.

Image removal and reupload is easily possible just not on the immediate next steps;
Could add a gallery feature and break out images into some models with relations.

List or book comments could be a neat feature and not a hard one to implement either.
